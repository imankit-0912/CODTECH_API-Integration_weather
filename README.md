# 🌦️ CODTECH\_API-Integration\_Weather

A simple, responsive weather web application that fetches and displays real-time weather data using a public weather API. Built as part of the **CODTECH Internship**, this project demonstrates front-end API integration, dynamic content loading, and responsive design principles.

## 📌 Features

* 🌍 Fetches live weather data based on city name input
* 📱 Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop
* 🌡️ Displays temperature, humidity, weather condition, and icons
* 🔄 Real-time API data loading with user interaction
* 🎨 Clean and interactive UI with basic animations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – Structure of the webpage
* **CSS3** – Styling and responsive layout
* **JavaScript** – API integration and dynamic content rendering
* **OpenWeatherMap API** – Free weather data source

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User enters the name of a city.
2. The app sends a request to the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
3. Weather data is fetched and dynamically displayed, including:

   * City & Country
   * Temperature (°C)
   * Weather condition (e.g., Clear, Rain)
   * Humidity and Wind Speed
4. An icon matching the weather condition is shown using API data.
